# oBloq Button

This is an example of an oBloq example file. It is an intentionally simple example used in order to show what oBloq is capable of.

## Style

Here is where we can provide CSS which is specific to the widget. Style can also be in stylus format (encouraged) and reference global styles. Stylus can provide namespacing, I believe.

``` css
button{
    border-radius: 20px;
    color: green;
}
```

## Structure

This is the template of a widget. Some notion of data content is implied. More thought needed on data models. Perhaps the data should also be namespaced?

``` html
<button class="{{class}}>{{title}}</button>
```

## Events

What events does the widget fire? What events does the widget respond to? Namespaces can be used here as well.

``` javascript
$('click', function(){
    alert('Aaargh, you got me');
});
```

## Wireframe

We can include text descriptions of wireframes, which will automatically be rendered using the sketchy plugin for documentation purposes. For pre-generated wireframes you can just include the png here instead, but text-based are preferred (images are nice for comparing with Photoshop comps as needed).

``` sketch
size 150 30
rect 0 0 150 30 Button
```

## Data models

What data is needed for this module?

## Permissions

Who should see this module? Who can edit it? Under what conditions?

## Tests

Here we can describe the tests desired. Layout tests are generally: layout, card, bar, or button. Other types can be added as needed. Not sure how to add unit, performance, or event testing yet.
